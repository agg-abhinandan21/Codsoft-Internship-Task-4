ðŸŽ® CodSoft Internship Task 4 Completed!

ðŸ”¹ Project: Rock-Paper-Scissors Game in Python

I'm happy to share the completion of my fourth task under the CodSoft Internship Program â€” a classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game built with Python. This project allowed me to strengthen my understanding of conditional logic and user interaction through a fun and engaging experience.

ðŸ§  Key Features:

âœ… User vs. Computer gameplay

âœ… Score tracking system

âœ… Input validation

âœ… Clear and interactive CLI-based interface

âœ… Replay option for multiple rounds

This project not only sharpened my logic-building skills but also helped me learn how to design better user experiences through terminal applications.

Excited to keep progressing and building more cool projects! ðŸš€
